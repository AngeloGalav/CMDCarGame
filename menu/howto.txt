How to Play:

Use the ARROW KEYS to move. Collect the Gas Tanks and avoid the other cars and mud puddles!
If you hit a car, you'll go back to the previous level!
If you get back to level 1 and you either hit a car or go below zero, you'll die!
Every 1000 points, you level up and the game will get harder, try not to die >:)

If you want to have a bigger window, just change the font size on the terminal options.

You can always go to the Game Over menu by pressing ESC during gameplay. This way you'll be
able to exit or restart the game at any time.
